Notes on Pushing Changes to Git from local devices:

1. git clone < link of github repo>
2. make changes to the files or folder inside the cloned folder 
3. git add . (to add the file or any changes you made)
4. git status (you can use this anytime to see the status of your changes)
5. git remote -v (to check the remote connection to the repo)

6. once you do git add . >> you should commit the changes by adding : git commit -m "comment for change"
7. git push origin main  >> to push the changes to the github repo.
