For our project we want to create a mutual aid crowdfunding database, modeled after web sites like Craigslist and goFundMe.

Stakeholders include entities creating listings and entities donating to the listings.

Milestone 1 will include a login page and option to create a listing.
Milestone 2 will be more refined and have bare bones graphic design as well as base functionality for the donating and making listing functions as well as user profiles and ability to create listings.
Milestone 3 will be more refined and have functionality.

Meetings will be before class every week, as well as virtual calls as needed (we have time blocked out if we need the time)

We found it easier to update the Google Doc for planning for more syncronous work, and using GitHub to work on the actual code of the project. We have a Discord server for communication.
